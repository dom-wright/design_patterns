Template

Allows you to define the skeleton or outline of an algorithm in a base class, while allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation for certain steps of the algorithm. The Template pattern follows the "Don't call us, we'll call you" principle, where the base class controls the overall algorithm flow and delegates certain steps to subclasses.

Django's class-based-views are an excellent example of the template pattern.
